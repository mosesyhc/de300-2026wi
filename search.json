Exploratory data analysis generally refers to the step of understanding the data:\n- summarizing characteristics of raw data - visualizing data (single and multiple variables) - identifying missing data - identifying outliers\nThis document primarily deals with the first two items.\nIn the exploratory phase, these are for people behind the scenes to see.\nThe main goals here are: - capture main message - (relatively) quick exploration across many summaries (including plots) - not intended for a client or presentation\nWhat does this translate to, technically? - each summary should have meaningful information - label your plots",
